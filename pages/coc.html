        <p>The MTG Community Summit is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone,
            regardless
            of
            gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
            race,
            age or
            religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is
            not
            appropriate for any event venue, including talks. Event
            participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the
            discretion of the event organizers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
        <ul>
            <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and
                expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion</li>
            <li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
            <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
            <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
            <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
            <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
            <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
            <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Enforcement</h4>
        <p>
            Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately
        </p>
        <p>
            Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the
            anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other
            material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or
            otherwise
            create a sexualized environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to
            keep
            the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from
            the
            event.
        </p>
        <p>
            Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting
            the
            event or making the environment hostile for any participants.
        </p>
        <p>
            We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We
            think
            people should follow these rules outside event activities too!
        </p>

        <h4>Reporting</h4>
        <p>
            If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Event

            violations
            reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our
            event
            a better place.
